Using a combination of solar panels, battery storage, and blockchain technology, we\'ll establish a neighborhood microgrid where residents can become both energy consumers and producers.\n\nSmart contracts will automatically manage energy distribution, payments, and grid balancing, reducing the need for centralized utility companies. This model promotes energy independence, reduces carbon emissions, and creates a more resilient local energy system that can operate even during wider grid outages.',
